Integrates highly optimized interactive charts (such as HSGuru Meta Scatter Plot and Vicious Syndicate Radar Networks) into your WordPress website using safe, high-performance shortcodes. Compatible with premium themes like Blocksy and Newspaper.

== Description ==

This plugin provides shortcodes to integrate professional interactive Hearthstone data visualizations powered by the Hearthstone Parses API:

1. **[hs_meta_scatter_standard]** - Displays an interactive HTML5 Canvas scatter plot representing the distribution of Standard meta archetypes based on their **Winrate** (X-axis) and **Popularity** (Y-axis), with active rank switching (Top Legend, Top 5k, Legend, Diamond 4-1).
2. **[hs_meta_scatter_wild]** - Displays an interactive HTML5 Canvas scatter plot representing the distribution of Wild meta archetypes based on their **Winrate** (X-axis) and **Popularity** (Y-axis), with active rank switching.
3. **[hs_vs_radar_chart]** - Displays an interactive force-directed network graph of card synergies matching Vicious Syndicate. It allows selecting classes, choosing specific archetypes, searching for individual cards, and viewing strongest synergy ties. Supports locking to a single class (e.g. Druid) with archetype filters!

Both shortcodes only load their JavaScript and CSS assets on pages where they are actually placed, preserving website speed and performance on other pages.

== Admin Menu ==

This plugin adds a helpful guide page under **Tools** (Инструменты -> Графики Hearthstone) with copy-to-clipboard buttons and full parameters reference.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `hs-parses-graphs-wp` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Place shortcodes on any page, post, or widget area.
