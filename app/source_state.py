"""Typed source-state enum (Phase 4).

``SourceState`` is a str-enum: members compare equal to the raw strings
("ok", "fetch_error", ...) and serialize to JSON as those strings, so the
wire format of status files, datasets, API responses and log events is
unchanged byte-for-byte.

NOTE on level sets: ``ERROR_STATES``/``WARN_STATES`` mirror the EXACT
historical mapping in ``refresh_log._level_for`` — ``quality_error`` is a
WARN state there (not an error), so it is deliberately excluded from
``ERROR_STATES``. Do not "fix" this without changing the log-level contract.
